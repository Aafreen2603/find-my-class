# find-my-class

As students of Thapar, we boast of our vast campus, but such a vast campus comes with its obstacles! Many students need help figuring out the location of the labs/halls in their schedule. The solution we have developed aims to solve this issue. It provides an easy-to-use and convenient method to locate them. Even during examinations and sessionals, most of the time, the rooms assigned are entirely foreign to the students.
 
The website has a simple and user-friendly interface. We can enter the lab/hall name we need to find and get its precise location, including the block, floor, room number, and other possible landmarks. Our solution would save time and effort and make things less chaotic and more organized for the students of Thapar University.
